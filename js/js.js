These choices should be heavily informed by the needs of customers. Managers should discover the relative importance customers place on attributes and then match the investment in excellence with those priorities. At Wal-Mart, for example, ambience and sales help are least valued by its customers, low prices and wide selection are most valued, and several other attributes rank at points in between. (See the exhibit “Wal-Mart’s Value Proposition” in David J. Collis and Michael G. Rukstad’s article “Can You Say What Your Strategy Is?”) The trade-offs Wal-Mart makes are deliberately informed by these preferences. The company optimizes specific aspects of its service offering to cater to its customers’ priorities, and it refuses to overinvest in underappreciated attributes. The fact that it takes a drubbing from comitors on things its customers care less about drives its overall performance.";
